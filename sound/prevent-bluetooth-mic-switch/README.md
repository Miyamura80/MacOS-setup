# MacOS annoying bluetooth problems

MacOS has a very annoying feature where whenever you connect a Bluetooth headphone, it will automatically try and change your input device into the connected Bluetooth device. 

This could be really really annoying, especially when your Bluetooth headphones has a bad mic and it can cause your audio to completely crumble when you are on calls. This script helps you ensure that whenever you connect your Bluetooth device it will update your default input device to your built in microphone every 10 seconds.

## Quick Start

To get rid of this problem, just run:

```
make all
```

## Requirements

Need to be on MacOS, and have `make` and `brew` installed.
